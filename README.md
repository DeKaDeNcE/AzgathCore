## Introduction

Az'gathCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *Trinity*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
